# What is a branch?

If we just used commits, it'd be quite difficult to navigate the repo.

"Which version are you working on?"
"Oh, 410defdd6c6"
"Oh damn, I'm only on fdb0eccf"

Instead, we use branches.

--

A branch is just a name that points to a commit.

It is a moving target.

This means that it points to the most recent commit in a sequence,
and you can *push* commits to it, updating what the branch name points to.

This is in contrast to tags, which are fixed targets.

---


# Managing branches

```{bash}
git branch
```

```{bash}
git branch another-branch
```
--
```{bash}
git switch another-branch
```
--
```{bash}
git switch - # switch to the ref (branch) we were last on
```
```{bash}
git branch -d another-branch
```

--

```{bash}
git switch -c another-quick-branch
git switch -
git branch -d another-quick-branch
```

---

# What is a remote?

A remote is just another repository.

Usually this is on a version control provider (GitHub).

It can be a folder on your computer, or a server somewhere else.

--

A remote contains branches, tags, and commits, some of which might also
be on your local machine.

When you *fetch* from a remote, just
as when you *clone* a repository, you should get all of the
commits stored on the remote, as well as any of the branches, tags, etc
(though this might not always be immediately obvious).


---

# Interacting with remotes

One of the main ways to interact with a remote is to `fetch` updates from it.
This will never edit or delete anything in your repo - from branches to commits to tags.

It will only ever add things!

```{bash}
git fetch origin
```

One side effect of `fetch` is that it will update your local copy of remote branches.
So after fetching, you could merge the latest `master`:

```{bash}
git merge origin/master
```

--

Equivalently, we can do both at once:

```{bash}
git pull origin master
```

---


# Local refs to remote branches

What do I mean by "local copy of remote branches"?  
Most branches we're concerned with are local branches:

```{bash}
git branch
```

However, git also has local copies of the branches on the remote(s). You can view
these local copies alongside your own branches:

```{bash}
git branch --all # or -a
```

Generally, and confusingly, `origin master` refers to the branch `master` on the remote
`origin`, while `origin/master` refers to a local copy of that
remote branch.

---

# Pushing

As well as fetching from remotes, we can also `push` our changes to them.
```{bash}
git switch -c new-branch-with-upstream
echo "Some changes" > a-file.txt
git add a-file.txt
git commit -m "Add a-file.txt"
```
```{bash, error = TRUE}
git push
```

--

```{bash}
git switch master
git branch -D new-branch-with-upstream # -D force deletes
```

---

# Managing remotes

You can add a remote using `git remote add`:

```{bash}
git remote add upstream git@github.com:/alanocallaghan/git-talk-2.git
git fetch upstream
```

```{bash}
git remote show
```

---

# Managing remotes

```{bash}
git remote show upstream
```
--

You can also edit remotes
```{bash}
git remote remove upstream
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:/alanocallaghan/git-talk.git
```

---

# A final note on remotes

I said earlier:
> Branches are cheap and easy
> Don't work on master/main

Why is this?

--

Well, because branches are easily split off, merged, deleted, updated, it's
much safer to push changes to a branch than to the main branch (`master` or `main`).

--

Any commits that are pushed to the main branch are in the repo forever, until
we rewrite history.

Imagine if you pushed a 10GB file to main --- even after deleting it,
every time somebody cloned the repo, they'd have to download that file!

--

If I push a 10GB file to a non-main branch, it's easier to catch mistakes
like that before they get merged into the main branch.

Any commits (and related objects/files) that are left orphaned (without a branch,
tag, etc, pointing to them) will be deleted by git's garbage collection.

---

# Exercise 2


- Fork the talk repo from https://github.com/alanocallaghan/git-talk.git
- Change the `origin` remote to refer to your fork
- Add a new remote called `upstream` that refers to the original repo
- Fetch from the upstream remote
- Merge the `upstream/instructions` branch.
- Follow the instructions in `instructions.txt` in that branch.


```{bash, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
git switch master
git reset --hard ${COMMIT}
```
