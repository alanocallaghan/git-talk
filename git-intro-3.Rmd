# How do you self-rescue?

As with all-self rescue, the best way is to avoid getting into trouble in the first place.

It's easiest to save yourself if you commit liberally and push carefully.

--

Often, `git reset` will come in handy.

--

`git reset --soft [ref]` will move the branch pointer to `ref`, with any changes
left staged. 

--

`git reset --hard [ref]` is much more aggressive - it will move the branch pointer
to `ref` and discard any changes.

--

`git reset [ref]` uses `--mixed`. This moves the branch pointer to `ref`,
and unstage any changes.

---

# How do you self-rescue?
Accidentally committed

```{bash}
git log -1 --oneline
```
```{bash}
git show HEAD~1 # view the last commit
```

---

# How do you self-rescue?
Accidentally committed

```{bash}
git reset HEAD~1 # or a specific commit SHA/hash
```

```bash
git add [...]
git commit [...] # commit the changes you really want
```

or, if you realise you did want all those changes after all, you could do

```{bash}
git reset HEAD@{1} # go back to the previous state of the repo, before I reset it to HEAD~1
```

---

# What is HEAD@{1}???

Truthfully, you can probably treat that as magic syntax.

Personally, I would instead use the amazing `git reflog` to find a specific
reference that I want to revert to.

Let's see:

```{bash}
git reflog -n 10
```

`reflog` is truly indispensable for self-rescue.

---

# How do you self-rescue?

Accidentally committed to the wrong branch

```{bash}
git branch new-branch
# git reset --hard origin/master # origin/master is the remote/branch
```
or, if you can remember some magic
```bash
# git reset ${upstream}
```

then
```{bash}
git switch new-branch
# after it's pushed/merged/done...
git switch -
git branch -d new-branch ## cleaning up the repo
```

---

# How do you self-rescue?
Accidentally pulled (merge conflict)

```{bash}
git fetch origin
```
```{bash, error = TRUE}
git merge origin/messy-branch
```
```{bash}
git status
```

---

# How do you self-rescue?
Accidentally pulled (merge conflict)

The simplest way to get out of this is to abort the merge!
```{bash}
git merge --abort
```

---

# Merge conflicts

The more complex way to deal with merge conflicts is to...

actually resolve the merge conflict, then commit the changes.

Unfortunately I can't help you much with this, it's difficult!

However, pulling often will make them less bad.


---

# How do you self-rescue?
Accidentally pushed changes to a remote.

Here be dragons...

Altering history on a feature branch is generally fine - we're usually working
on these alone, or in small groups.

--

Altering history on `main` or `master` is risky.

If you rewrite history, but I don't, and I push some unrelated changes,
then whatever you removed will be added back in as part of my push.

You need to ensure that
everybody else who can push to the repo is aware of what you're doing,
and is willing to reset to your version - otherwise, the changes will end
up being pushed again, along with big merge conflicts!

---

# How do you self-rescue?
Rewriting history on a remote

Best only done if:

- you're the only person working on the repo
- it's a private repo with a few contributors
- it's required (private/sensitive data, huge files committed)...

---

# How do you self-rescue?
Rewriting history on a remote

The basic process would be something like this:

- Copy the repo to a new location if you're not 100% confident
- Reset to a previous state.
- Double- and triple- check that you've removed whatever you need to remove
- Check again
- `git push --force` to the remote
- Ask other contributors to reset to your version by running something like:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git reset --hard origin/main
  ```
  Of course, because this is a `hard` reset, they will lose any changes ---
  this is why you need to coordinate this kind of action.

---

# Other actions

If people want, I can cover some of the following on another day:

```bash
git mv # as it sounds, move a file
git rm # as it sounds, remove a file
git stash # save changes for later, without committing (beware!)
git cherry-pick # copy a commit from one branch to another
git rebase # rewrite history (useful for merge requests, but can be messy!)
git revert # undo a commit
git bisect # advanced, but really useful for finding bugs
git blame # find when different parts of a file were last changed
# probably easier to use github's blame!
git worktree # have multiple versions of the same repository in different folders
```

---

# Other git magic

It's also possible to do some more advanced things with git, such as:

Splitting history (make a subdirectory into its own repo)

--

Adding a repository as a subdirectory (merging repos)

--

Submodules (repositories within repositories)

--

These are all relatively easy, but the answers can be better found
on StackOverflow than I can explain right now.
