# Outline

- How do we do common tasks?

- What do we need to know?

- How do you rescue yourself from messy situations?

---

# Disclaimer

I am not really a git expert.

--

I will probably say multiple things that are completely wrong or misleading.

--

I have simply used git for a while, and am willing to look up commands and
occasionally break my repos, which means I am now familiar with git.

--

I still frequently make mistakes when managing repositories.

--

Making mistakes is usually fine, and easily fixable, as long as you follow some
basic rules.

---

# How should you use git?

- Commit often, commit everything

  - Don't *push* everything, though

--

- Branches are cheap and easy

  - Don't work on master/main unless you're the repo is private and/or you're working alone

--

- Pull often, or reap the reward of huge merge conflicts

--

- Reasonably informative commit messages and "atomic" commits are ideal,
  but not always practical

---

# What is a git repo?

Fundamentally, it's just a directory with a special `.git` folder.

The `.git` folder contains every version of all of the files in the repository,
as well as metadata like branches, tags, and remotes.

To add files to git, they first need to be **staged**, then **committed**.

---

# Staging

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git-add.png")
```
--
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git-commit-a.png")
```

---

# git demonstrations

The code for this talk is written in a git repo.

The commands I've written
here should mostly work in another repo if you want to follow along.

However I've tried to provide some small exercises to try them out yourself,
so don't feel obliged.

---

# Staging demonstration

```{bash}
echo "my new" > new-file.txt
git status
```

```{bash}
git add new-file.txt
```

--

```{bash}
git status
```

---

# Committing changes

```{bash}
git commit -m "Add new-file.txt"
```

--

Oops! I forgot a word in my initial commit. I'm going to *amend* the commit.

```{bash}
echo "my new file" > new-file.txt
git commit -a --amend -m "Add new-file.txt"
```

--

This is handy for trying to create "atomic" commits, where each commit is a
working version of the code (not always feasible, but ideal).

---

# Committing changes (again)

```{bash}
echo "another new file" > another-new-file.txt
git add . # add all files in the current directory
git commit -m "Add another-new-file.txt"
```

--

Actually, I want to add some emphasis to that new file.
```{bash}
echo "another new file!!!!!" > another-new-file.txt
git commit -am "Make sure people know it's an exciting file"
```

---

# Rolling back changes

Actually, I think my enthusiasm was a bit misplaced.

Let's roll those changes back, so we get back to the original state of the repo.

```{bash}
git reset HEAD~1 # revert the repo to the previous commit, but keep the changes on disk
```

```{bash}
git status
```

---

# Rolling back changes on disk

First, let's see what our unstaged changes are, to be sure we're happy discarding
them.

```{bash}
git diff # view the unstaged changes
```
Yep, I'm happy to discard those changes.
--
```{bash}
git restore another-new-file.txt # restore the file to the state it was in the last commit
```
```{bash}
git status
```

---

# Removing untracked changes

Hmm... Maybe a file that says "my new file" isn't crucial...
or indeed another file that says "another new file".
Let's roll this back.

```{bash}
git reset HEAD~2 # go back two commits
```
```{bash}
git status
```

--

Okay, let's remove both of those untracked files.
```{bash}
git clean -f # better to use -n/--dry-run, or -i (interactive) to be safe
```

Done!

---

# Exercise 1

- Clone the repo https://github.com/alanocallaghan/git-talk.git
- Add a file using echo or a text editor with the text "I'm using git on the command line, oh no!"
- Add this change to the staging area and commit it, preferably with a suitably scary commit message
- Change "oh no!" in the file to "oh yes!"
- Stage this change and amend the previous commit, optionally changing the commit message to be a bit more optimistic
- Revert the repository to the state it was in when you cloned it
  (note: there are multiple ways to do this, some of which we'll cover later)



---

# So, what is a commit anyway?

A commit is a snapshot of the repo.

It has a reference to the previous commit, and a snapshot of the repository.

Commits are referenced by a hash, which is a unique identifier for that commit.

---

# So, what is a commit anyway?

You can find out what the last commit was with:

```{bash}
git log -1
```

And view it with

```{bash}
git show HEAD~1 # or git show [HASH}
```

---


```{bash, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
git switch master
git reset --hard ${COMMIT}
```
